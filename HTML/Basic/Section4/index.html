    <p>Inside the HTML element there are two main elements Head, Body</p>
    <h3>Body</h3>
    <p>The body element contains the content of the document, such as text, images, and other media.</p>

    <p>The head element contains metadata about the document, such as the title, character set, and links to stylesheets or scripts.</p>
    <h3>There is one more element that is outside the root html element</h3>
    <p>The doctype declaration is not an HTML element, but it is used to specify the version of HTML being used in the document.</p>
    <h3>Example of a doctype declaration</h3>
    <p>The doctype declaration for HTML5 is <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>.</p>
